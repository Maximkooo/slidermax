# slidermax.js

Reveal CSS animation as you scroll down a page. By default, you can use it to trigger animate.css animations. But you can easily change the settings to your favorite animation library.

Advantages:

Super simple to install, and works with animate.css, so if you already use it, that will be very fast to setup
Fast execution and lightweight code: the browser will like it
You can change the settings (duration, delay)
